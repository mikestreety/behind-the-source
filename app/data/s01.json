                    "answer": "<p>I have been interested in computers and programming for as long as I can remember: I was 7 when my parents bought the family a ZX Spectrum +2 which I began programming on by copying code from magazines. I continued programming as a hobby on the Acorn Archimedes, Amiga and then PC, while also dabbling in graphics software to satiate my love of design too. I modded (before modding was a thing) games like 1991’s Manchester United Europe to replace them with my preferred team, Wolverhampton Wanderers &#x1f604;<br /><br />It was 1996 when I finished secondary school, and during that time was given many opportunities to use the Internet over a 28.8Kbps dial-up connection. For the next 2 years at college, I studied a general Information Systems course which introduced me to a lot of different technologies and domains, but it was the Human Computer Interfaces module, where I built an interactive, web-based dinosaur encyclopaedia, that really set my heart alight: the web was the perfect hybrid of allowing me to embrace coding and design/UI at the same time.</p>\n<p>After leaving college, I couldn’t find a developer job so quickly rose up the ranks in a pie factory, before going to Australia for a little while. When I returned, I saw an ad at a local online travel agency (think early Expedia), so I offered to volunteer my time to learn the ropes in a professional setting. I took in a portfolio of things I’d built on the web, and they offered me a job straight away! I stayed there for a year or so, before I had enough of flagrantly plagiarising other people’s work, and left to teach basic computer literacy to the elderly and people looking for work (thinking “being a tutor” may look better on my CV since I wanted to emigrate to Australia).</p>\n<p>I stopped being a tutor after a year, and became a web developer at Stanley Gibbons, a market leader in philately (all things stamp related). I was in a team of 2, with my colleague handling the ASP, and me building all of the HTML and CSS and JavaScript. We did some pretty cool stuff for 2004, like building an online stamp portfolio management system.</p>\n<p>I moved to Australia in 2006, and immediately contracted to one of the largest media publishers as the sole front-end developer in a small team tasked with rebuilding all of their flagship websites to… remove their content. They were unfortunately putting all their eggs in a Macromedia Flex paywall basket, and let’s just say it (luckily) didn’t go as planned.</p>\n<p>After 6 months of daily, 6 hour round trip commutes nearly killing me, I found a senior Front-End Developer job in a local, “technical” agency. I spent 9 years leading the front-end direction of the team, building things for all sorts of clients: small business, banks, local and national government, which is where I learned to embrace the importance of web accessibility.</p>\n<p>After working with or for everyone in my hometown of Newcastle, I decided to try the bigger Sydney market. I had a short, toxic stint at a famous Australian email marketing company, then had a great time at a leading sports publisher learning React and functional programming along the way. I then went headfirst into working remotely for a company in California, before doing 2 years remotely leading the front-end team at a national sporting body to rebuild all 19 websites and 38 apps.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, I’m now the UX Engineering Architect at Hireup, a for-purpose startup that is helping to build a more inclusive community. Here, I remotely lead the direction of the UI engineering and the user experiences we build for all users, regardless of their ability.</p>\n"

Vue is just easy to learn, feature-rich and flexible enough to perform in many different environments.</p>\n<p>After writing CSS for nearly 20 years and creating many frameworks along the way, I’m now heavily into atomic CSS; writing yet another framework that we use and love at work.</p>\n<p>I’ve been a Mac user for 4 years (although I customise it to make some things more Windows-like… thank you uBar, Contexts and Spectacle!) and my preferred editor is Atom, which I’ve heavily customised as well. I’ve tried VS Code many times, but I just can’t get on-board with it. I’m not sure what the future holds since technically Microsoft owns both, but I will hold on to Atom for as long as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>I’m big into Design Systems and component libraries.

We had to make a website for a band on the course which was my first experience of web development. </p>\n<p>In my final year, I had to write a dissertation (which was daunting for me because I'm dyslexic) so my housemate and I did a swap; he helped me write my dissertation and I made him a website for one of his modules. Someone saw that site and asked me to make one for them - I said I'd do it for £50 and ever since I've been blagging it.</p>\n<p>I worked for myself creating WordPress sites for small businesses when I first started out. A couple of years ago I contracted for a few UK companies while living out on the west coast of Canada. I've had a couple of creative agency jobs and now I've got my first permanent product role. I really like my current role as I've been able to specialise just working on the frontend.</p>\n<p>I’ve always wanted to live in the mountains for a winter season. My ideal place to go was North America but Canada is a lot easier to get a visa than the USA. I was also interested in living in Canada as a place for the future. My partner and I went to Whistler which is the largest resort in Canada and had an awesome time. I managed to get 91 days in on the mountain.. We were there for 8 months then bought an old converted van and spent 3 months doing 7000 miles around the west coast of Canada and the USA. We decided to come back after our trip to the UK. </p>"

This allows us to create the components for our Pattern library. The data files are all <em>.json</em> and the HTML is handcrafted by us. For styles we use Sass and all the JavaScript is only presentational. It's compiled with Rollup.js and then Docker is used to get everything running.</p>\n<p>I’ve been creating pattern libraries for a good five years now so I’ll be honest I don’t really think about it too much. The hardest part I find is keeping it as DRY as possible and naming things. I’m quite into Sass which I think makes life a heck of a lot easier when it comes to maintaining the pattern library.</p>\n<p>The middleware at work is a Node.js and Express setup. As much as possible our API does the bulk of the work which is written in PHP/symphony - I don’t touch the API code!</p>\n<p>My computer at work is a 13” MacBook Pro, which is pretty rad. Before I’ve only used a 15” laptop but now I think the slightly smaller size and lighter machine is the way forward.

Through my role I’m able to learn a lot more about accessibility and put it at the centre of my work. Through the coaching I receive at work I’ve had the confidence to create a workshop; Accessibility 101 and presented it to the whole company. Off the back of that other parts of the business really started to grasp it. Now we’re writing an accessibility statement, the content team is really behind it and I will be talking to our clients about it. I’ve been able to give the talk at a bunch of local meetups too.<br /><br />Work life balance is respected at Studee - I get to work remotely four days a week and in general we’re super flexible as a company. We aren’t measured on how much time we work but on our output. I’m a big believer this is how all business should be.<br /><p>We have business projects that we break down into engineering projects. An engineering project is then made up of a series of deliverable tasks which are no more than 3 days work. On a Thursday we go over what we have defined for the next week and decide how much work we can take on. If I didn’t take on enough work we always have non-critical defects or code improvements I can work on. Because the culture is so honest and positive at Studee, I don’t worry about my output too much. We really trust each other to get the work done and meet the business deadlines.<br /><br />Studee is <a href=\"https://studee.com/giving-back/\">passionate about taking responsibility for its impact as a business</a>. We get three paid days a year off to volunteer for organisations that we care about. We’re creating scholarships through a charity in Myanmar to give students there the opportunity to further their studies. Studee are also planting trees for every student we enrol to offset the carbon of their flights.</p>"

I know there are zero config build tool options out there but I never managed to get them to just work straight away. <br /><br />JavaScript frameworks are super cool and can be the perfect tool but they shouldn’t be the thing you immediately reach for. There needs to be a reason you’d be reaching for a framework as opposed to a different solution. Working at Studee with the tech stack that was started before I came on board has really reinforced this. I hadn’t used Mustache or Node/Express before but they are very readable with a low barrier for entry. I didn’t get it right away but after a few weeks it all made sense. The reason I was able to understand Node/Express is because I’ve been lucky to have time to learn vanilla JavaScript. I’m not the world's best JS dev by any means, but I know enoughto be able to transfer my skills to any framework.<br /><br />Accessibility should be the first thing we think of. If you do then it solves a LOT of other issues. SEO, valid HTML, progressive enhancement, performance etc. The main factor for me is it’s the <em>right</em> thing to do. In 2016 I went to Render conf and Robin Christopherson, an accessibility legend, did this amazing talk about considering <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/165995026\">how making your website accessible doesn’t just benefit disabled people</a>; it benefits everyone. I HIGHLY recommend checking it out - after watching this I was inspired to try and make everything from there on out as accessible as possible.</p>"

As soon as I got into a team at my first agency, Mr B &amp; Friends my skills exponentially accelerated. It wasn't just having senior people around me to help me when I was stuck.

It also made me feel a lot better about being stuck because everyone was getting stuck sometimes - even the lead dev with 10 years experience.</p>"

We help people design and develop great digital products.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I’ve done both managing others and also production work as part of my day-to-day. I don’t think there’s anything such as a ‘normal’ day as it varies week to week. </p>\n<p>I schedule in work and client meetings, and also help others on demand - i.e. if a developer has a question about something that wasn’t covered in designs I often help out fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p>I do find that setting out a portion of your day for uninterrupted work and the other half for meetings to be useful if you can. Once I learned that it was OK not always helping people immediately, but instead scheduling things at a certain time, it became much easier to reach and stay in flow. With the rise of asynchronous communication tools, things have become very interrupt-driven, and I’m trying to fight against this. </p>\n<p>Changing your Slack status to ‘head down - do not disturb’ then switching it off works wonders when you need to focus. People will always come and tap you on the shoulder if there is a real emergency.</p>\n<p>For me, as a designer, 50% of our job is design - the other 50% is communication - something that’s often lost on junior designers. </p>\n<p>Far too many designers have a hard time moving into management and feel that they aren’t doing real work, once they move over to more ‘people’ type things, when in fact giving guidance, critique and help to someone else who might be doing the work can be equally valid.</p>\n"

I’ve found myself slowly moving up the stack (over about 20 years) following my interests as they evolved!</p>\n<p><em>[Mike: Big change - what made you go from back-end to front-end?]</em></p>\n<p>A big change indeed! I think it was mainly curiosity how things worked on the front end, and then once I was doing front end dev I started reaching out to customers for their input, and doing some user testing and realised the real value people working in both design and UX provide, so wanted to learn more about that.</p>\n<p>I’m a firm believer that people can have many careers (often in 3-5 year chunks), and shouldn’t stay doing anything when they feel they have outgrown it. Trying different things broadens the mind, and makes you aware of how other disciplines work, which can be helpful as you progress in your career.</p>\n<p>I’m happiest being a generalist and found each of those roles had enough crossover in skills to bridge the gap to move onto the next one, while I learnt.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know ‘what I wanted to do when I grew up’ but knew I wanted to go to university, so did a course that was split between Business, Computing, and HCI (human-computer interaction, which evolved into what we know as UX today). It was a ‘sandwich’ course, with a year working for Microsoft in SQL Server support in my third year - this was my first exposure to working in the tech industry and was invaluable. </p>\n<p>When I started it was very much expected that people had a degree, but now this isn’t the case - some of the most brilliant people I work with have gone straight into working and gaining experience, which I think now is the most important thing one can have.</p>\n<p>While at university I got into frontend development, working part-time doing HTML/CSS editing for some of the university departments, learning about web standards and accessibility. I then ended up working at several agencies in Oxford for several years, before leading the web team for Nominet, the UK domain registry. </p>\n<p>My interest in UX &amp; design then grew, and I started UXOxford (a UX meet-up/speaker series) which I co-ran for several years.

While people seem to respond well to visual mockups, I like getting things into code as soon as I can, as that's where one can see the real edges of things, and you can properly understand how something works in a real browser. </p>\n<p>Even spiking out things with mock data in a ‘living’ style guide can be helpful, as one can see how things behave responsively and can be tested in different devices/browsers more easily, even before you wire things up and develop properly.</p>\n<p>For my own site I have a website built in <a href=\"https://getkirby.com\">Kirby CMS</a> which I love, and use Netlify for things that can be static.</p>"

They show the outside world a more comprehensive picture of people who work in tech, broadening who I follow and pay attention to in our industry.<br /><br />I'd encourage you to explore sites like these and start listening to, following and promoting under-represented people, whether people of colour, women, folks over 50, LGBTQIA folks, working parents, the disabled, etc. There's plenty of room for all of us, and I guarantee you'll leave inspired.</p>\n<p>Secondly, tribalism.

I'm lucky to work in an industry where people are willing to share knowledge, and I'm always learning from others, both as a designer and developer.</p>\n<p>If I'm feeling tired or burnt out, I like getting away from technology and screens for a bit. Going for a run or doing something creative with your hands gives the brain a rest and recharges you. You’ll find some of your best ideas will come when doing other things like this.</p>\n<p>My advice to you is to be open to trying new things and follow your heart. Try not to compare yourselves to others. Most of what people are putting online is a highlight reel, and most of us are learning as we go in reality. </p>\n<p>Do things you don’t know how to do, share and document your work - whatever stage you’re at, there’s always going to be people learning coming up behind you! But don’t try and fill every waking hour with design or development, as that way burnout beckons. You don’t have to work all the time - be kind to yourself and have some fun!</p>\n"

                    "answer": "<p>I went quite a roundabout route to get to where I am today. My parents moved to South Africa when I was about 10 and I went to uni there, studying photography. I worked freelance for a couple of years, doing photography and a bit of graphic design.<br /><br />But when I moved back to the UK I lost all my connections and struggled to get that going again. I did bartending for a while and then managed to get a job doing photo retouching at a modelling agency. That wasn’t the best time. It didn’t sit well with me from a moral standpoint, and the work was incredibly tedious. I was comfortable though, and honestly, probably a little uncertain of my own abilities at that point, so I didn’t have the confidence to leave. Luckily, (in retrospect) I got made redundant, so that decision was made for me.<br /><br />I got back into pub work and started learning how to code in my spare time. It can be quite isolating learning to code, there’s a lot of sitting and frowning at error messages, and feeling a bit stupid. Finding the <a href=\"https://codebar.io/brighton\">Brighton Codebar</a> community and attending their free workshops really helped to build my confidence.</p>\n<p>A year or so later I had my first job at an ad agency, I found my love for web animation there, as I was making a lot of banner ads and jazzy landing pages.<br /></p>\n<p>There’s only so long you can focus your energy on building things that everybody hides with ad-blocking software. I wanted to build things that were more useful, and had a bit more impact, so I started job hunting, luckily Clearleft were on the hunt for a Junior at the same time.<br /></p><p>It was someone, rather than something that caught my imagination and got me into coding. Around the time I got made redundant, I went to a house party, and met a woman who’d just finished a coding bootcamp. She was spectacular, loud, excitable, brimming with enthusiasm for everything she’d learnt. We talked drunkenly at each other for hours. </p><p>Her enthusiasm reminded me of the excitement I felt back in the early 2000’s, making custom myspace profiles and neopets pages for friends. I hadn’t thought about that for years.<br /><br />On her recommendation I went to a free coding workshop at Le wagon. I felt pretty out of my depth, but I met another wonderful woman there, Jen. She introduced me to Codebar Brighton and took the time to give me guidance and advice. We sadly lost Jen to depression late last year. </p><p>I’m forever grateful to Jen. You never know how much a conversation or small act of kindness is going to have on someone's life. I try to emulate that whenever possible.</p>"

I’m not super happy with the experience I had at university when it came to my area of study and feel like I missed out on some fundamentals when it came to design, but I graduated and getting that first job was really hard. </p><p>I had 3 jobs before Microsoft, not including the freelance work I used to do on the side. I worked part-time for a small local company in Bellingham, WA doing very unglamorous design work in an unglamorous office (it was a barn) and was just hungry to get experience. So I spent 6 months there and was then hired on at a start-up in Bellevue, WA called Point Inside that had a mobile app. I spent a year doing production design work and user interface work for the app. </p><p>After a year I was referred by a former classmate for a position at a Public Relations agency on their creative team. That was my so-called “big” break. I spent 4 years at the agency and worked my way up from doing production work, like designing PowerPoint templates, event invites, miscellaneous print materials and infographics to becoming an Experience Designer. I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle when it came to websites: I’d do the research, wireframes, visual design and front-end development. We’d hire a developer when we needed some more complex functionality that was out of my skill range. </p><p>That was where I really fell in love with the web and building for it. After 4 years at that agency, I was hired onto the Microsoft Edge team as a Program Manager but I was doing design work for our developer-facing web properties and only in the last year have I switched out of that design role into a more developer engagement and advocate type role. </p>"

For me, I’m lucky that I get to learn as a part of my job. I get to keep my finger on what’s hot in the dev community, what tools are people using, what framework, etc. And I believe you should never stop learning because there’s always something new <em>to </em>learn. If you went to university, you don’t graduate knowing it all, and perhaps that’s one thing I wish I could tell myself: it’s okay to not know it all, you don’t know and you never will, but curiosity and willingness to learn new things will take you far.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>I originally started out learning to code about four years ago while working as a customer service agent for a large utility company. I wanted a change and decided to utilise my employees learning scheme to learn something new.</p>\n<p>I enrolled at Brighton MET for an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 8 week evening course - it was really good fun and included quite a bit of practical work and helped my skills increase quickly in a nurturing environment. After completing this course, I followed on with another 8-week course for PHP and MySQL, which I equally enjoyed as the logic behind this language really interested me.</p>\n<p>\t</p>\n<p><em><strong>[Mike: Having now worked as Junior Developer for 2 years and knowing what is “right”, did the course teach “up-to-date” techniques or was it outdated?] </strong></em></p>\n<p>The course taught me basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was good to set up the basic building blocks to Web Development, so I wouldn't say this is outdated, as getting the basics right is key to web development and is a good place to start. We used Notepad++ as the editor and made simple web pages with text and images and the course did teach good structure for code. It was a great place to start and then look into further more advanced techniques after myself.</p>\n<p>After the night classes, I was introduced to <a href=\"https://codebar.io/brighton\">Codebar Brighton</a>, a local group that meets up once a week and helps underrepresented groups in tech get into coding. The group is run by local developers who give up their free time to help others - which is amazing. Getting to see the insides of some tech companies in Brighton and being surrounded by the community was a great boost for me, I learned so much from the developers who gave up their time for me. </p>\n<p>I then knew that a dev job is what I wanted to do. I began looking around and sending email questions to local companies - some replied with helpful answers and some not. I asked about roles and, if possible, asking for directions to go as a new dev if they didn't have any jobs available. Being open about my skills and what I could and couldn't do helped a lot when it came to getting answers from companies. I soon managed to apply for a role at my current job Tilt who appreciated my honest approach and were willing to take on a Junior Developer to help educate and give an opportunity to grow. </p>\n<p>This is my first dev job and I'm really grateful for the opportunity that I have been given, as entry-level jobs can be hard to find. My advice to any new dev is to be honest when applying for jobs and also if you do interview ask them questions as you are interviewing them as well as them interviewing you. </p>"

                    "answer": "<p>I currently work on various projects utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also build and maintain projects in Wordpress using PHP and MySQL for databases. Occasionally I will help out with bug fixing on the Laravel built projects. Other projects I also work with use Drupal, which I maintain the code including modules and security updates. </p><p>I do interact with servers, making updates that have been done locally to staging environments and also pushing changes live. I recently learnt how to set up Linux servers for development; making sure that these are secure for projects to be used on. I thought server setup would be daunting but it's been good and lots of documentation exists out there to help. </p><p>I mainly use Sublime Text to code with day to day and use chrome as my main browser to locally build with the use of dev tools. However, I do use all browsers to cross-browser test. The terminal is my friend along with using Git for version control is great and easy to use. Also, a Spotify account is a <strong>must</strong> to have some great dev playlist playing while I work. </p><p>Working on code is great, but understanding more about how the back end works is something that I was curious about. The command line helps so much on my day to day as making sure version control for code is important and a small git command make a big difference when saving your work. It was a lot to learn initially, the command line wasn’t taught to me in the college course, but documentation online has been really helpful to learn this. Also, one thing I advise is getting used to typing in the commands manually, as copy and paste is great but typing will commit the command to memory and make you understand it more. <br /><br />It’s a bit like a Stack Overflow issue that you find. You get your answer in a code snippet and can copy and paste it to solve your problem, but if you don't understand the code and what it does it is pretty much useless. Taking time to understand and type in the command helps so much in the long run. <em>[Mike: It also helps when you are on a machine you can't copy and paste to]</em><br /><br />I found the jump different but went in with an open mind and the best thing to do is just start using it, the more you use it the better your skills become and remember that there is documentation out there.</p>"

In the end, you (or at least me) ,end up being a fancy PR person that can make buttons. It also requires so <em>muuuuch</em> traveling, which was spiralling me into a mental breakdown. </p><p>Most of my joy in this job comes from coding and building things. I like teaching people but after being a developer advocate and a developer, I learned that I can get the best of being a developer advocate and do it in a developer position, all it takes is finding a good company.</p>"

I've spent the last few months sourcing, persuading and pleading with people to be interviewed, so we can take a peak behind the masks of developers, designers and people in the web.</p>\n<p>Lined up I have 8 fantastic interviews with people from all walks of life and have posed to them the same 8 questions about their jobs, their backgrounds, their feelings about the industry and what tools they use to do their work.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the series, you'll notice a theme which runs through each of the interviews. It is one that will probably come as no surprise. Our industry is filled with lovely, open, sharing people but also intoxicated with prejudice, gatekeeping cliques. I hope, for everyone's sake, the former outweigh the latter.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank every single one of the interviewees for giving up their time to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>Make sure you <a href=\"{entry:236@1:url}\">Sign up to the newsletter</a> or <a href=\"/rss\">subscribe to the RSS feed</a> to be kept up to date.</p>\n<h2>Episode Guide</h2>\n<p>The following interviews will be going live over the next couple of months.
